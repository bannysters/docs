title: "Global Variables"
---


These global variables are injected into your Lua environment when using 9Auth. They help you personalize user experience, enforce access control, and track usage. No manual setup required — just reference them directly in your scripts.

---

## 🧑‍💻 Discord Information

### `AuthDiscordUsername`

> **Type:** `string`\
> **Example:** `"user#1234"` or `"N/A"`

The user’s Discord username and discriminator. Use this to personalize in-game experiences or audit usage.

**Usage:**

```lua
print(_G.AuthDiscordUsername)
-- Output: user#1234
```

---

### `AuthDiscordId`

> **Type:** `string`\
> **Example:** `"123456789012345678"` or `"N/A"`

A unique, numeric Discord user ID. Useful for linking game activity to Discord accounts.

**Usage:**

```lua
print(_G.AuthDiscordId)
-- Output: 123456789012345678
```

---

## ⏱️ Key Duration & Time Remaining

### `AuthDays`

> **Type:** `number`\
> **Example:** `30`

Total duration of the user’s key in days. This does not decrease over time.

**Usage:**

```lua
print(_G.AuthDays)
-- Output: 30
```

---

### `AuthTimeLeftUnix`

> **Type:** `number` (Unix timestamp)\
> **Example:** `1700000000`

Time remaining on the user's key in seconds. Useful for calculating time-based restrictions.

**Convert to seconds left:**

```lua
local secondsLeft = _G.AuthTimeLeftUnix - os.time()
print("Time left: " .. secondsLeft .. " seconds")
```

---

## 📈 Usage Metrics

### `AuthUsageCount`

> **Type:** `number`\
> **Example:** `5`

Number of times the script has been executed by the current user. Great for tracking or limiting usage.

**Usage:**

```lua
print(_G.AuthUsageCount)
-- Output: 5
```

---

## 🔁 HWID Management

### `LastHwidResetUnix`

> **Type:** `number` (Unix timestamp)\
> **Example:** `1690000000`

The time the user last reset their HWID. Use this to enforce cooldowns on resets.

**Check cooldown logic:**

```lua
local hoursSinceReset = (os.time() - _G.LastHwidResetUnix) / 3600
if hoursSinceReset < 24 then
    warn("You must wait before resetting HWID again.")
end
```

> ✅ These variables are preloaded and safe to use at runtime. You don’t need to call or fetch anything — just access them directly through `_G`.
