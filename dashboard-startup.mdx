  Make sure you have a Discord account ready — 9auth uses Discord for authentication.

1. **Go to 9auth.xyz**  
   Open your browser and navigate to [https://9auth.xyz](https://9auth.xyz). You’ll see a sleek landing page inviting you to log in.

2. **Login with Discord**  
   - Click the **Login with Discord** button in the top-right corner.  
   - In the Discord OAuth prompt, authorize 9auth to access your basic account info.  
   - Once authorized, you’ll be redirected back to the 9auth dashboard.

3. **Select Your Server**  
   - On the dashboard homepage, you’ll see a list of Discord servers where you have “Manage Server” permission.  
   - Click on the server you want to manage. This loads your server-specific dashboard view.

4. **Create a New Script Entry**  
   - In the server dashboard, click the green **“+”** button next to your script tabs.  
   - A modal will appear prompting you to **enter a name** for your new script.  
   - Type a descriptive name (e.g., `myFirstScript`) and click **Create**.  
   - Your new script will appear in the tab list (e.g., “myFirstScript”). Click that tab to open its management panel.

5. **Upload Raw Script Contents**  
   - With your script tab selected, locate the **Raw Contents** card.  
   - Click **Choose File**, select your `.lua` script file, and then click **Upload**.  
   - You’ll see a code preview (e.g., `print("test script loaded!")`) once it’s successfully uploaded.

6. **Add Keys**  
   - Click the orange **Add Keys** button in the upper-right of the script panel.  
   - In the modal, choose to **generate keys automatically** or **upload a CSV** of pre-generated keys.  
   - Set any key-specific options (e.g., expiration, usage limits), then confirm to create them.  
   - Your new keys will appear under the **Keys** table, showing each key and its lifetime.

7. **View & Manage Users**  
   - Scroll to the **Users** section to see which Discord users have activated a key.  
   - Columns include:  
     - **Key** (the key string)  
     - **User ID**  
     - **Username**  
     - **Usage Count** (how many times they ran the script)  
     - **Executor** (if available)  
     - **Lifetime** (days)  
     - **Expiration (Unix)**  
   - Use this table to monitor active users and usage metrics in real time.

8. **Configure Server & Script Settings**  
   - Scroll to **Server & Script Settings** at the bottom of the panel.  
     1. **HWID Reset Timeout (in hours)**  
        - Drag the slider or type a number (e.g., `24`) to set how often a user’s hardware ID resets.  
     2. **Execution Log Webhook**  
        - Paste your Discord or external webhook URL to receive real-time notifications whenever the script executes.  
     3. **Crack-Detection Webhook** *(coming soon)*  
        - Reserved for future functionality; leave blank for now.  
   - Click **Update Settings** to save all changes.
